    <p>Hello. I am Jayneel. I am a masters student in product design at the TU Delft, currently in my second year, I am looking for graduation opportunities in the fields of automotive and material driven design.
        I have a background in Mechanical engineering and I enjoy working in environments that mix the two domains of my study, that is why my design style and preference for projects are to find engineered solutions for design problems
